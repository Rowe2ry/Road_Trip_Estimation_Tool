        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <br>
        <h4> Q: How does Getaway adjust for speed or traffic patterns?</h4>
        <p> A: Getaway calculations are based on an average speed of 60 miles
            per hour. Currently, traffic patterns are not factored. Speed and
            traffic patterns are scheduled to be included in the next Getaway update.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Q: We have several drivers on this trip. We want to drive straight, with only gas
        stops. Can Getaway factor in our 17 hours-no stop preference?</h4>
        <p> A: Getaway values safe driving practices, therefore our calculations are
        based on 15-minute restroom breaks every 2 hours and a maximum drive time of 10 hours
        per day. For trips requiring more than 10 hours of drive time, a hotel stay will
        be scheduled. A 30 minute stop for lunch and 1 hour stop for dinner is also included
        in the travel time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Q: I drive a Model S Tesla, can Getaway account for my charging time?</h4>
        <p> A: Getaway Version 1.0 does not support charging time for electric cars. Fuel stops
        are based on a driving range of 300 miles and the assumption that vehicle starts with a full
        tank of gas.
        <br>
        <br>
        Input parameters for gas mileage and vehicle type will be included in Getaway Version 2.0
